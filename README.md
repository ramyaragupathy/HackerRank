- Start with Easy, unsolved challenges. Use the filter in each section to filter such problems
- Under easy, look for those that has high success rate, usually between >80%
- Not all problem statments are clear. You need to look at failed test cases to fine tune your code. 
Test cases come up when you submit your code for evaluation. Some test cases need to be pruchased with hackos points, usually 5 hackos, while some are free. These hacko points gets addedto your account based on the points you earn from solving challenges.
- Sorting based challenges are easier to solve. They have higher points. So solving them first not only boosts your points, but also propels your rank better.
- Within string section, there are certain challenges labelled easy, but they are actually not.
- In case of timeout failures, you have to optimise your code to perform better. When you face this issue, try to timebox code optimisation, otherwise ther are chances that you get lost for hours.
Usually such errors pop up for loop inside loop. Then you have to start looking at better searching and sorting techniques for performance improvement.
- If you can't figure out the reason for test case failure, look at discussions setion. There're chances that the problem statement is not clear and fellow hackers might have actually listed out scenarios for better understanding of the challenge.
- While looking at discussion board, avoid looking at other solutions provided.It's advisable to come up with your own solution for a strong foundation in algorithms.
- Not all solutions require you to traverse data structure. Mathematical tricks involving a general formula helps. Taht way you can also avoid timeout failures for large inputs. You just need to get creative, address challenges efficiently.
